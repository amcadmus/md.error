	well known, the cumulative production varies linearly with the pressure
	to compressibility factor ratio. However, the instantaneous production
	(that is to say, the instantaneous standard volume of the released
	gas) varies in a totally different manner when looked as a function
	of pressure; in particular, at any temperature above the critical,
	this production goes through a maximum which is more and more pronounced
	when approaching the critical point. The locus of these maxima defines
	in pressure-temperature coordinates a curve which starts at the critical
	point, goes through a maximum and ends at the Boyle temperature.
	This new characteristic curve is analyzed and some rather surprising
	features are presented in this paper. For pure component systems,
	this curve coincides with the locus of maximum density fluctuations.

  abstract = {Inhomogeneity is the most fundamental concept which characterizes
	the states of supercritical fluids, and density fluctuation is a
	measure of the inhomogeneity in the distribution of molecules. To
	investigate the substance dependence of the inhomogeneity, small-angle
	X-ray scattering experiments and thermodynamic calculations have
	been carried out for supercritical CO2 and CF3H and the contour maps
	and their ridges have been drawn on the phase diagrams. The contour
	maps and the ridges for both samples are similar and the magnitudes
	of the density fluctuation are almost the same at the same reduced
	thermodynamic states. The ridges connect smoothly with the rectilinear
	diameters. The physical meaning of a ridge is stated in terms of
	the effective volume occupied by molecules. It is concluded that
	the ridge is the boundary which separates the supercritical region
	into two a more liquid-like region and a more gas-like region. (C)

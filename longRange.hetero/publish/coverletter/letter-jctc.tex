\opening{Dear Editors,\vskip .5cm}
Hereby we would like to submit our article: 
\textit{``The Numerical Accuracy of Computing Electrostatic Interaction
  in the Inhomogeneous and Correlated Molecular Systems:
  for the Ewald Summation, SPME and Staggered Mesh Ewald Methods''
} by H. Wang, P. Zhang and C. Sch\"utte to the
\textit{Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation}, as a regular article.

This paper developed the error estimates for three state-of-art
algorithms of calculating the electrostatic interaction in a charged
system.  They are the Ewald summation, the smooth particle mesh Ewald
(SPME) and the staggered mesh Ewald methods.  The main contribution of
the present paper is to extend the previous error estimates, which
assume the homogeneity and indenpendency of charges, to the
inhomogeneous and correlated systems. The importance of considering
the inhomogeneity and correlation contributions in realistic molecular
systems was discussed, in order to show the present work is an
important step towards providing sharp error estimates for
practically interested molecular simulations.

% Comparing with previous error
% studies that ideally assume the system is homogeneous and
% uncorrelated, the error estimates of the present paper also work
% in inhomogeneous and correlated systems.



% The molecular dynamics simulation of the inhomogeneous molecular
% systems, in which the density of a certain type of atom is lack of
% uniformity, will encounter non-trivial difficulties by using the
% standard cut-off method.



% The simulation results are found to converge
% only at a very large cut-off radius, so it is computationally very
% expensive to obtain precise measurement of the physical properties.\\

% To quantitatively study the cut-off artifact, we developed an accurate
% error estimate of the standard cut-off method for the inhomogeneous
% systems. We proved that the root mean square force error is decomposed
% into three additive parts: the homogeneity error, the inhomogeneity
% error and the correlation error.  An important observation is that the
% inhomogeneity error is dominant in the interfacial regions where the
% density changes rapidly, and can be more than one order of magnitude
% larger than the error in the bulk regions where the density is
% comparatively uniform.  Therefore, a large cut-off value should be
% used to suppress the maximum error in the interfacial regions, but at
% the mean time,
% considerable computational effort is wasted in the bulk regions. \\

% We proposed the adaptive cut-off and the force correction method to
% avoid the mentioned problem. The adaptive cut-off method uses different
% cut-off radii for the interfacial and bulk regions so that the error
% is uniformly distributed across the system. The force correction
% method removes the inhomogeneity error, therefore, the precision of
% force calculation is improved, so a smaller cut-off radius is
% acceptable. Both of the proposed methods relies on the quantitative
% analysis of the short-range force error.  The effectiveness of
% the proposed methods were checked by molecular dynamics simulations of
% the liquid-vapor equilibrium and the nanoscale
% particle collision.\\

% Most of previous error estimates in this field assumed the homogeneity
% of the system. As far as we know, the present work for the first time
% proposed an error estimate for the short-range interactions in the
% inhomogeneous molecular systems, presenting new phenomena that do not
% happen in the homogeneous systems.  We showed that the adaptive cut-off
% and the force correction methods greatly improve the efficiency and
% accuracy, and successfully avoid the problem of the standard cut-off
% method, so they should be of special interest for
% understanding the inhomogeneous molecular systems, and for
% designing high
% performance molecular simulation softwares.
